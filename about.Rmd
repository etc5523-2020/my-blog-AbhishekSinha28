My name is Abhishek Sinha. I am a Masters student at Monash University majoring in Business Analytics.

This blog provides an updated analysis of the Coronavirus pandemic in different parts of the world. It starts with analyzing the situation in **Germany**, one of the few countries that manage to bend the curve of new cases.

There will be more interesting analysis coming soon for different countries.

Enjoy !
